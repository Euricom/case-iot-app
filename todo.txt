- solve 409 conflicts when sending commands too fast. Probably due to time processing the command.
=> idea: poll status for x seconds after command sent. re-enable after x seconds or when status has changed.
- test on actual mobile devices
- add specs
- deployment to app stores
- graceful error handling when AD authentication does not work

BUGS:
- take picture does not work ? refresh after does not show new image.
- sliding pictures on mobile does not work
- AD login via mobile does not work
- hot reloading does not reload status
