TASKS:
- improve polling strategy: (after command sent: disable button, 2 x settimeout (if status !== requested), enable button and force status to current status.
- add specs
- setup deployment to app stores
- graceful error handling when AD authentication does not work
- add readme: API docu: https://eurismartoffice.azurewebsites.net/swagger/

BUGS:
- unauth after long time: refetch credentials
- hot reloading does not reload status
=> idea: optimize loading/init and reloading of status
- counter of images is incorrect 18/17 (after swiping last image twice?)
